# Wifi_UDP
This code sends a UDP message over wifi using Adafruit FeatherM0+ATWINC1500 wifi module. It uses Adafruit Neotrellis 8x8 keyboard as an interface. 
the UDP message is captured by another FeatherM0+ATWINC1500 connected to the USB port of a computer. It generates a MIDI message and sends it over 
USB where a MIDI enabled software such as GarageBAnd can pick it up.
